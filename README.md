SPACE SHOOTER (For now)
This is a classic space shooter game where you spawn in a spaceship and defend your base from incoming enemies. If more than three enemies cross your base, you lose. If a spaceship crashes into you, it's game over.
Controls:
- W A S D to move
- Space to shoot

My Notes:
Hi, I’m Abdullah! This is my submission for Moonshot. I’m pretty new to coding and just getting started with Godot. I spent my first 20 hours learning the platform by building Flappy Bird from scratch instead of 
copying a tutorial, but by experimenting, breaking things, and figuring out how they work through trial and error. After that, I jumped into this space shooter tycoon idea. 
I’ve spent most of my time debugging, testing, and trying to understand how to make everything work properly. From player death logic to sound triggers and UI, I kept changing things until they felt right.
It wasn’t easy, but I learned a tonnn and had a blast doing it. Thanks for checking out my game, I really hope you enjoy it!!!!!!!!!!!!
